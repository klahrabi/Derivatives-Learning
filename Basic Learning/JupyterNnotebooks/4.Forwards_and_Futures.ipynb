    "## Introduction to Forwards and Futures\n",
    "Forwards and futures are derivatives contracts that allow two parties to agree on the price at which an asset will be bought or sold at a future date. Unlike options, **forwards and futures represent an obligation**, meaning both parties are required to fulfill the contract terms at expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences from Options\n",
    "- **Obligation**: In a forward or futures contract, both parties are obligated to complete the transaction. In contrast, an option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell.\n",
    "- **Customization and Trading Venue**: Forwards are customized and traded over-the-counter (OTC), while futures are standardized and traded on exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores types of forwards and futures, their payoff structures, and practical applications.\n"

    "There are various types of forwards and futures contracts, each serving different markets and purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commodity Futures\n",
    "Commodity futures are contracts to buy or sell physical commodities (e.g., oil, gold) at a specified price and date in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Currency Forwards\n",
    "Currency forwards allow parties to lock in an exchange rate for a specified amount of foreign currency on a future date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equity Futures\n",
    "Equity futures are contracts based on stock indices (e.g., S&P 500) or individual stocks, allowing speculation on the future price of an equity or index.\n",

    "To further understand forwards and futures, let's consider the timeline of such contracts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contract Initiation**: The buyer and seller agree on a price (forward price) for the transaction at expiration.\n",
    "2. **Periodic Updates (for Futures)**: Futures contracts are marked-to-market daily, meaning gains and losses are settled each day. This is different from forwards, which settle only at expiration.\n",
    "3. **Expiration**: At expiration, the contract is settled, either through physical delivery of the asset or cash settlement based on the difference between the asset's spot price and the agreed-upon price.\n",
    "\n",
    "This timeline helps highlight the **obligatory nature** of these contracts, as both parties are committed to the terms from initiation to expiration.\n"

    "The pricing of forwards and futures is based on the concept of the **cost of carry**, accounting for costs and benefits of holding the asset until expiration.\n",
