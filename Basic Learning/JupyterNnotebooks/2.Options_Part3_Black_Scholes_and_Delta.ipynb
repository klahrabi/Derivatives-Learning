    "## Understanding the Black-Scholes Formula Intuitively\n",
    "The Black-Scholes formula is a cornerstone in options pricing, used to calculate the theoretical value of European-style options. Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton, it allows us to price options based on certain assumptions about the market and the asset's price behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Intuitions Behind the Formula\n",
    "The formula consists of two main components:\n",
    "1. **The Expected Asset Price (Adjusted for Probability)**: This is represented by $S \\cdot N(d_1)$, which estimates the probability-adjusted value of the asset if the option were exercised.\n",
    "2. **The Present Value of the Strike Price**: This is represented by $K \\cdot e^{-rT} \\cdot N(d_2)$, which adjusts the strike price for the risk-free rate and the probability of exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Black-Scholes Formula for European Call and Put Options\n",
    "For a European call option:\n",
    "$$C = S \\cdot N(d_1) - K \\cdot e^{-rT} \\cdot N(d_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a European put option:\n",
    "$$P = K \\cdot e^{-rT} \\cdot N(-d_2) - S \\cdot N(-d_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $S$: Current stock price\n",
    "- $K$: Strike price of the option\n",
    "- $T$: Time to expiration (in years)\n",
    "- $r$: Risk-free interest rate\n",
    "- $\\sigma$: Volatility of the stock\n",
    "- $N(\\cdot)$: Cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\n",
    "- $d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S / K) + (r + 0.5 \\sigma^2) T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}$\n",
    "- $d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking Down $d_1$ and $d_2$\n",
    "- **$d_1$** represents the probability-adjusted expected return of the asset relative to the strike price, incorporating volatility and the time to expiration.\n",
    "- **$d_2$** is related to the probability that the option will expire in the money, taking into account the time and volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why $N(d_1)$ and $N(d_2)$?\n",
    "- **$N(d_1)$**: Gives the probability (in a risk-neutral context) that the option will be exercised, i.e., that the asset price will exceed the strike price.\n",
    "- **$N(d_2)$**: Reflects the adjusted probability of payoff at the strike price, factoring in the time value of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula essentially finds the expected payoff by adjusting the probabilities using the risk-free rate and the asset's volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visualize the effect of varying each of these parameters.\n"

    "## Classical Delta Derived from Black-Scholes\n",
    "**Delta** is a measure of an option's price sensitivity to small changes in the price of the underlying asset. It is a critical \"Greek\" in option trading and risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivation of Delta for Call and Put Options\n",
    "For a European call option, Delta ($\\Delta_{call}$) is derived by taking the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the stock price, $S$:\n",
    "$$\\Delta_{call} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} = N(d_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a European put option, Delta ($\\Delta_{put}$) is given by:\n",
    "$$\\Delta_{put} = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial S} = N(d_1) - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitive Interpretation of Delta\n",
    "- **Call Options**: Delta for a call option ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the extent to which the option's price will move with a change in the stock price. A Delta close to 1 implies a high sensitivity to the underlying price, meaning the option behaves almost like the stock itself.\n",
    "- **Put Options**: Delta for a put option ranges from -1 to 0. A Delta close to -1 indicates strong sensitivity to price movements, but in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta can also be interpreted as the probability of the option expiring in-the-money in a risk-neutral context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization of Delta Behavior\n",
    "We will plot Delta for call and put options across a range of stock prices to visualize how it changes with respect to the underlying asset.\n"
