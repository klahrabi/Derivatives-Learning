    "## Overview of Swaps\n",
    "Swaps are derivative contracts in which two parties agree to exchange cash flows or other financial instruments over a set period. Swaps are widely used in finance for managing interest rate, credit, and market risks, as well as for speculative purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Types of Swaps\n",
    "1. **Interest Rate Swaps (IRS)**: Exchange of interest rate payments, usually between fixed and floating rates.\n",
    "2. **Total Return Swaps (TRS)**: Exchange of total return on an asset (e.g., equity or bond) for a fixed or floating rate.\n",
    "3. **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**: Insurance-like swaps that transfer credit risk from one party to another.\n",
    "4. **Swaptions**: Options on swaps, allowing the holder to enter into a swap under pre-specified terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explore each of these swaps, their structure, cash flows, and common uses.\n"

    "## 1. Interest Rate Swaps (IRS)\n",
    "Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) are contracts where two parties exchange interest payments on a notional principal over a period. The most common type involves one party paying a fixed rate and the other paying a floating rate, based on a benchmark rate like LIBOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of an Interest Rate Swap\n",
    "- **Fixed Leg**: One party pays a fixed interest rate on the notional principal.\n",
    "- **Floating Leg**: The other party pays a floating interest rate, which resets periodically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases for IRS\n",
    "- **Hedging**: Corporations or financial institutions use IRS to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates.\n",
    "- **Speculation**: Investors may speculate on the direction of interest rates by entering swaps.\n",

    "A Total Return Swap (TRS) allows one party to receive the total return of an asset (such as equity or bond) while paying a floating rate, typically LIBOR plus a spread. The other party receives the floating rate while paying the asset's return.\n",

    "### Use Cases for TRS\n",
